After reading the third module over the 12 keys to success, I personally believe that the 6th key will be the hardest for me. Crumpling the paper tiger might be difficult for me, not because I struggle with thinking outside the box and solving problems creatively. But because I fear that I will not think of the correct solution as quickly as one may expect. I eventually will struggle my way through the problem on my own. But fighting the urge to just turn and ask for help may prove to be more challenging than originally anticipated.
